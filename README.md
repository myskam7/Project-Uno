# Project-OverWatch.GG

# Concept:

There lot of websites applications that contain information on the latest video games out there, for Overwatch.GG we wanted to create one ourselves based on the popular video game "Overwatch". What sets our project apart from the others is that our project provides as a main hub containing most if not all the information you could get out your selected hero from Overwatch. This was also the motivation for the project as we felt it took a new direction of where video games information sites were headed.

This project took around a three days of development and was finished sometime around September 21, 2017.

# Design Process:


We felt that displaying our data dynamically in one page would be the best option going forward in the project. We also felt the need to use apis to grab the external data of other websites like youtube and display visual information(like gameplay footage) to the user.

# Technologies we used:

jQuery, for dynamically displaying data to the html and working json object.

Overwatch Api, we used this api to pull information(like abilities and difficulty level) of the user's selected hero. We achieved this thru ajax calls.

Youtube Api, we used this api to pull gameplay footage of the user's selected hero. We achieved this thru ajax calls.

Boostrap v4, for addtional css styling and making the site more mobile friendly.

Chart.js, a javascript libary providing us tools to create our data into a more visual representation.

# Plans for future Development:

Features we would love to add in the project is extracting more data from outside sources(ex. instead of currently linking the user to another site for more info. we would rather grab the data out of those external websites and display it dynamically to our page).

We would love to add user input validation for a youtube search bar and a search bar for the hero selection if and when the list of heros gets bigger.

We would want to actually display our data of the selected hero's information and videos via a bootstrap modal.
